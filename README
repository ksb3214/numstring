Numstring

This is a very simple example of a small program to enumerate a string.

I made this as a really very insecure way of being able to provide individual letters of a long complex password.

Compile

This should be pretty simple on all platforms...

gcc -o numstring main.c

For fun I did a bash version...

./numstring.sh <string>
